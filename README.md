# RetroXRBWallet

**Warning this is super beta test, your wallet seed is unencrypted in the config.ini file (though not passed to the server) so please just use this for testing**

## Installation

You will need:
* Python3
* Pip3 (to install the required libraries


* Go into the python-pure25519-blake directory and install this `python3 setup.py install`
* Run the wallet `python3 gui.py`, when it errors install the necessary libs (I'll add a list soon), for `websocket` the lib is actually `websocket-client`


## Tips
* You can copy from the wallet by holding down your OSes modifier key, OS X its *fn*, and selecting the address
